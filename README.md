# Pi Extras
## Introduction
Pi Extras is an APT repository with extra packages for Raspberry Pi. Automatic update scripts are running in the background, providing latest software to users.

The purpose of its establishment is to make up for the software ecology of the Raspberry Pi. And it is also an alternative to [Raspbian Addons](https://github.com/raspbian-addons) which has been abandoned by its maintainer.

**This project is under construction and it is not available currently.**
